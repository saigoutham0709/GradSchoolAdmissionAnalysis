# GradSchoolAdmissionAnalysis
Choosing the best graduation college with the available scores is one of the most important aspects of
graduating from high school. For our final project we selected a dataset which gives us the admission
chances based on the scores obtained in several competitive exams, we initially created several
visualizations in R-Studio to visually represent the data for different variables and compared the variables
with the chance of admission to determine what all factors are responsible for one to get an admission. We
created and analyzed different regression models like linear, logistic, and random forest to find the best
fitting model with maximum accuracy and least error possible.
